Last year [Louis Columbus](https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/#7a3e7ef539e0) of Forbes stated that [Machine Learning Engineers, Data Scientists, and Big Data Engineers rank among the top emerging jobs on LinkedIn](https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2017/12/11/linkedins-fastest-growing-jobs-today-are-in-data-science-machine-learning/#733bba4d51bd). [David Robinson's](https://stackoverflow.blog/authors/drobinson/) Stackoverflow article about [The Incredible Growth of Python](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/?_ga=2.89377243.1384298729.1532773871-1665501156.1497260571) substantiates this observation.

Data science in the UK is still emerging, whereas in the US it appears to have taken off in a big way.  

It is encouraging to [read about mainstream adoption in the UK](https://www.ft.com/content/d9b3511c-90da-11e8-b639-7680cedcc421), even if still early days. The imminent [5G](https://5g.co.uk/guides/what-is-5g/ ) mobile data revolution will fuel the [Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things), and will no doubt accelerate and result in a step-change in sources, volume, and variety of data, catapulting data science and associated disciplines into the stratosphere.

It raises exciting prospects.  I am thrilled to be part of this and decided to get more involved.  I realise though that, in order to achieve this, I need to participate and contribute more to the ongoing discussion.  Thus, I am going to do a lot more online, starting with this website.

I've been meaning to create a website for a while now, and recently and unexpectedly got some time to do it.  The intention is not to create the world's best blogging site, but to get a fit-for-purpose web presence as quickly and efficiently as possible.

#### This website helps me to achieve a few things in particular:

**Showcasing** <br>
Publish my insights on extracts and highlights from my work in a single and controlled environment.
  
**Curating** <br>

  > [The more I learn, the more I realise how much I don't know](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein).  I will **never** stop learning.  

Data science and its tools have grown exponentially during the last decade.  There is a lot of information available today, and much of it is unoriginal, inaccurate, incomplete, out-of-date or badly written or explained.  Also, there are many approaches and tools to accomplish a task, and often it is difficult to choose a way forward. <br><br>
    I have however found many tried, tested and current sources that I continue to draw on, and which I would like to share and comment on.

**Giving back** <br>
  I have benefited tremendously from [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) software, using programming languages like [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [Python](https://www.python.org), in particular *the* [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) compendium of libraries lead by [Hadley Wikham](http://hadley.nz) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) by [Wes McKinney](http://wesmckinney.com). <br><br>
  Additionally, there are many altruistic engineers that continue to build on this collaboration, providing free advice through [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) for example,  or free quality education, like Kevin Markham of [dataschool](https://www.dataschool.io/about/) in his [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnVzApLJE2ljPZSeQylSEyg) series of data science tutorials.<br><br>
  This website allows me to pay it forward.

#### Some technical blurb about the website
After some research, I have decided to follow the [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/installation.html) approach, provided and explained by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name).  It's taken me a day to cover basic training and setup and I am really chuffed with the result.

The static website is using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) framework and [Beautiful Hugo](https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo) theme.  The source code is pushed to a [GitHub](https://github.com) repository.  The website is hosted on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com).  Netlify automatically pulls the code from GitHub and builds the website.  Easy and seamsless.

So, hello world!  Here it starts with more to follow...
