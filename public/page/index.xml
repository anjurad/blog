      <description>I have a ‘go-to’ list of quality and up-to-date sources of information that I continuously draw upon either as a reference, for training, detecting patterns and trends, or comparison and evaluation.
The list covers Python and R environments, two common programming languages supporting a plethora of libraries used to solve data science problems.
I have mapped the list to the data science process, and the skills and knowledge supporting it. I hope that it saves you time and help focus on relevant and critical aspects using quality, vetted information.</description>
